Multilevel Monitoring of Activity and Sleep in Healthy people (MMASH) dataset provides 24 hours of continuous beat-to-beat heart data, triaxial accelerometer data, sleep quality, physical activity and psychological characteristics (i.e., anxiety status, stress events and emotions) for 22 healthy participants. Moreover, saliva bio-markers (i.e.cortisol and melatonin) and activity log were also provided in this dataset. The MMASH dataset will enable researchers to test the correlations between physical activity, sleep quality, and psychological characteristics.

The Python Notebook provided in this repository is useful to read and analyze MMASH dataset.
